# Basics of Programming in C Language

This repository contains lab works completed as part of the **Basics of Programming in C Language** course.

## Lab Work 1: Standard Input and Output
This was a simple test focused on basic input/output operations in C.

---

## Lab Work 2: Basic Concepts of C Language
Find the first `n` natural numbers that are equal to the sum of the factorials of their digits. Example: 145 = 1! + 4! + 5!.

---

## Lab Work 3: Bitwise Operations in C
Remove the digit '1' from the octal representation of a given number.

---

## Lab Work 4: Type Conversion
Read integer numbers from the keyboard until zero is entered. Store these numbers as floating-point values in normalized form, separating them with spaces.

---

## Lab Work 5: Using Functions with 2D Arrays
Given an array of square matrices, determine how many matrices have rows arranged in non-increasing order of their elements.

---

## Lab Work 6: Using Functions with Strings
Transform a string by replacing each digit with the corresponding number of spaces (e.g., '0' becomes 0 spaces, '1' becomes 1 space, '2' becomes 2 spaces, etc.).

---

## Lab Work 7: Arrays and Pointers
Given a matrix `A`, find the product of `A` and its transpose (`A * A^T`).

---

## Lab Work 8: Dynamic Arrays of Strings
Find the longest common word between two given texts.

---

## Lab Work 9: Using Structures
Find the sum of `n` fractions, represented as irreducible fractions. Each fraction is stored as a structure with two fields: numerator and denominator. Functions are used for input, output, reducing fractions, and finding the sum.

---

## Lab Work 10: File Handling
- **Task 1**: Given a text file, find the longest word that starts with the letter 'a'. If no such word exists, report that. Write all words that start with 'a' to another file.
- **Task 2**: Given a binary file of structures containing city names and populations (sorted in non-decreasing order of population), rearrange the file so that the cities are sorted in non-increasing order of population.

## Lab Work 11: Using Function Pointers and Creating Multi-File Programs
There is information about students in a group: their full names and the results of the last exam session. The task is to generate a list of students with their average scores, sorted either lexicographically or by non-increasing average score, as chosen by the user.
